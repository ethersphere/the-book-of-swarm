These are hidden if conditional text is not shown (when publishing a version).

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item any version being worked on should be named "Version vX - worked on";
    \item when publishing, "worked on" should be removed; 
    \item drafttrue line should be commented out removing conditional text upon compilation;
    \item PDF should be generated, saved and pushed to Github repo \\ (https://github.com/ethersphere/publish-bookofswarm/tree/master/pdfs); 
    \item verify that last commit was autodeployed to Swarm \\ (https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/the-book-of-swarm-viktor-tron.pdf);
    \item PDF commit in Github repo should be named with version number;
