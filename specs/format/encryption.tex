Symmetric encryption in Swarm is using a slightly modified version blockcipher in counter mode.

The encryption seed for the chunk is derived from the master seed if given, otherwise just generated randomly. 

The reference to a single chunk (and the whole content) is the concatenation of the hash of encrypted data and the decryption key (see \ref{def:chunk-reference}). This means the encrypted Swarm reference (64 bytes) will be longer than the unencrypted one (32 bytes). When a node syncs encrypted chunks, it does not share the full references (or the decryption keys) with the other nodes in any way.  Therefore, other nodes will be unable to access the original data, or in fact, even to detect whether a chunk is encrypted.

Encrypted Swarm chunks are not different from plaintext chunks and therefore no change is needed on the P2P protocol level to accommodate them. The proposed encryption scheme is end-to-end, meaning that encryption and decryption is done on endpoints, i.e., where the http proxy layer runs. This has an important consequence that public gateways cannot be used for encrypted content. On the other hand, the apiary modular design allows for client side encryption on top of external  APIs while proxying all other calls via the gateway.
